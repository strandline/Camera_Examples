Notes on hardware compatibility

  Please note: All USB CMOS-cameras with USB board revision < 2.1 are not 
  supported by driver versions > 3.10.
  How can you check whether your camera is affected?

  Check the serial number of your camera. If it is less than 
  400 26 27000, your camera will not be compatible with driver 
  versions > 3.10.

  If your camera is not compatible with driver versions > 3.10, you can 
  of course continue to use your present driver (up to version 2.40).


  
  Please note: 

  The correct firmware of a GigE uc480 SE camera is automatically 
  uploaded with driver versions >= 3.50. This process is only available 
  if the firmware version on the camera is also >= 3.50. If not, The 
  camera can not be opened and is labeled respectively in the 
  uc480 Camera Manager. The firmware must be uploaded manually over the 
  button 'Upload starter firmware'. The firmware file is located in the 
  installation directory in the folder 'GigE Firmware'. Once updated with
  the new firmware, the automatic upload is available for future updates. 


  Please note:

  We recommend not to change the DHCP configuration of the network adapter
  while operating the uc480 cameras. If you encounter difficulties, you 
  should reboot your computer system with the desired configuration.

  
  Please note:
 
  The GigE-HE camera family is officially supported by driver version 
  4.40.1 for the last time.
  
  The GigE-RE camera family is officially supported by driver version 
  4.80.0 for the last time.

Notes on this release 4.80

- Support of Windows 10

- Support of the new USB3 CP Rev. 2 camera models SC0800G13C/M, 
  SC1920G23C/M, SC2592G10C/M.
  
- Increased maximum possible frame rate of the USB3 CP Rev. 2 camera models
  SC2048G23C/M/N and SC2048G11C/M/N.

- Additional pixel clocks for the USB3 CP Rev. 2 camera models SC1283G12C/M
  and resulting an increased maximum possible frame rate. 
  
- All USB3 CP Rev.2 camera models (except SC4912R12C) support I2C with the 
  GPIOs.
  
- The USB3 firmware is no longer included in the driver, but stored on the
  hard disk. Therefore the driver needs less main memory.
  
- In the Vertical AOI Merge Mode each line trigger can now cause a flash 
  signal. 

- The standby button in the uc480 Viewer is available for the C2592R14C.

- The streaming dialog in the uc480 Viewer is available for the 
  SC4216R12C/C2592R14C.
  
- Optimization and bugfixing.


Please note: The internal image memory of the USB3 CP Rev. 2 camera family
             can no longer be enabled/disabled when the camera is opened.   
             This is only possible in the closed state. However, the setting
             is saved permanently in the camera. The setting is no longer 
             configured over the uc480 Viewer but over the uc480 Camera Manager.

             Parameter files with image memory entries must be adjusted!

Please note: When the pixel clock is changed while operating the SC4912R12C, 
             there are sporadic reconnects. This problem increases with the 
             camera temperature. It will be solved in the next SDK version.
